<i>Look at this.</i>

<i>Baby cakes.</i>

4
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,980
<i>Talk to the angels.</i>

00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,940
<i>It's one o'clock in the morning
and you're wide awake.</i>

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,630
<i>I love you. Bless you.</i>

7
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,100
<i>What do you have to say?</i>

8
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,800
<i>Yeah.</i>

9
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,520

10
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,720
<i>Mama.</i>

11
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,330
<i>Yeah.</i>

12
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,290

13
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,860
<i>Let me see.</i>

14
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,820
<i>Let me see you swim.</i>

15
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,840
<i>Are you sweeping?</i>

16
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,180
<i>Say "I love you."</i>

17
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,950
Hey, sorry. I'm here alone.

18
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,930
- Would you like coffee?
- That'd be great.

19
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,430
- I'd like a hot tea.
- Okay.

20
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,360
This is so really bad.

21
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,590
It's fine.

22
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,130
This is the grossest place
I've ever seen in my life.

23
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,800
- It's fine.
- It's dirty.

24
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,240
It's local.

25
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,410
Mom, you said we need to leave at 11.

26
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,600
I know, honey.
But Agnes isn't here yet.

27
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,350
We have to wait for her, sweetie.
I promise, we're gonna leave soon.

28
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,790
What is that like the third time this week?

29
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,260
Next time it's going out of your paycheck.

30
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,740
Dale, where's my eggs over?

31
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,240
- Right here. You said up.
- I said easy.

32
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,200
- Give me 5 minutes.
- Well, I don't have 5 minutes.

33
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,840
- I got to get out of here.
- Jeez.

34
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,100
Okay, darling.

35
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,040
How about you colored it up
for your mother.

36
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,700
Okay.

37
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll get it later.

38
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,400
- Crawfish Friday?
- Crawfish are good.

39
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,230
Just peel the tail back
and suck all the juice out the head.

40
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,080
- You suck juice out of the head?
- Yeah.

41
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,240
- What?
- Yeah, you just...

42
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,740
Okay. Here's a Belgian waffle and bacon.

43
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,200
Where the hash browns?

44
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,620
- You ordered bacon.
- I want it hash browns.

45
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,440
- Okay, I can get you that. No problem.
- No, he's fine.

46
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,100
- You ordered bacon.
- I want it hash browns.

47
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,250
Come on.

48
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,220
Tyler, eat. He's fine.

49
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,590
- Okay. Short stack with eggs.
- That's grandma's.

50
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,670
Mom, breakfast!

51
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,110
I can't eat now. I just took my pills.

52
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,930
You know what, you can have
grandma's potatoes.

53
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,110
I don't want hers.

54
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,310
Tyler, knock it off.

55
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,290
Okay, egg white omelet for you.

56
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,350
- Honey.
- Yes, ma'am?

57
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,710
You remind me of my daughter.

58
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,900
- Doesn't she look like Stephanie?
- Mom, I'm your daughter. Stephanie.

59
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,260
I'm your daughter.

60
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,590
- Tabasco?
- Okay, I'll get your Tabasco.

61
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,170
And your eggs will be right up, sir.

62
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,330
- Where's Agnes, Bill?
- Late?

63
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,160
- You trying to be funny?
- No, she's not answering her phone.

64
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,690
She might have overslept.
Can you do a double?

65
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,300
Can't, I got plans with my kid.
Call Alan.

66
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,370
Okay, hot coffee.

67
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,780
No, no, no. I would like
herbal tea, please.

68
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,700
Okay, I'll get you an herbal tea.

69
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,590
- Did you guys get menus?
- No, but we'd like some.

70
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,500
- Claire.
- What? Like we're supposed to guess?

71
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,080
- I'll be right back.
- Do your job.

72
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,740
Okay, I'm so sorry about that.
Here you go.

73
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,760
Silverware.

74
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,190
- Is everybody good here now?
- He's sulking.

75
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,750
I am not.

76
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,580
You know what, can you just bring us side hash browns?

77
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,190
- Burnt on the edges.
- Burnt on the edges, coming up.

78
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,410
- We're good.
- Okay.

79
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,100
Still waiting on my eggs.

80
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,810
Right. Your eggs are coming right up.

81
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,330
Yeah, and can I actually get...

82
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,860
Can I switch to wheat toast
instead of white toast, is that alright?

83
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,750
Yeah, wheat instead of white.
Yep, got it.

84
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,370
- Thank you.
- Be right back.

85
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,930
New side of hash browns,
burnt on the edges.

86
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,360
Copy.

87
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,650
Miss!

88
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,430
Don't yell.

89
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,710
Miss!

90
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,620
- Please stop yelling.
- Shut up.

91
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,460
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

92
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,360
But Karla's kid sitting here waiting
for her to take him to the park.

93
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,630
Yeah, so you can come in?

94
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,400
So come in.

95
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,270
Here you go.

96
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:36,330
All the herbal tea you could
possibly want and two menus.

97
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,590
Is your oatmeal steel?

98
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,850
- What?
- Cut.

99
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,730
- Are your oats steel-cut?
- No, they're Quaker.

100
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,900
- Should I come back...
- No, no.

101
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,960
Oatmeal with...

102
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,380
I'll take with with reduced fat almond.

103
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,960
Oh, let me guess,
you only have wholemeal?

104
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,830
- From the Outer?
- No, from AMP.

105
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,810
Why don't I just apply it
directly to my thighs?

106
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,190
You could use some help.

107
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,030
Karla, go ahead and go.

108
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,480
- Really?
- Yeah. Dale found Agnes.

109
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,480
- She should be here in 15 minutes.
- Awesome.

110
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,560
- Who wants to go to the park?
- I am!

111
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,750
Let's go.

112
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,730
Mommy, your turn.

113
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,950
Is daddy coming to the fair?

114
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,370
No, sweetheart.
You're gonna see daddy next weekend.

115
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,290
And maybe you'll get to see Cheryl too.

116
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,270
Do you like Cheryl?

117
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,450
- I don't know.
- I think she's nice, Frankie.

118
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,240
And she's smart.
She's very smart.

119
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,100
- She's gonna be a doctor.
- Yeah, I know.

120
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,660
And I want you to really
make friends with her, okay?

121
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,090
Are you friends with her?

122
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,170
Yeah.

123
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,720
Yeah, I am.

124
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,500
She, daddy and I,
we all love somebody like crazy.

125
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,010
- Do you know who that is?
- Me!

126
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,780
You!

127
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,190
You.

128
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,560
We all love you.

129
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,330
Mommy, can I get ice cream?

130
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,360
You know what, how about
we check out all of our options first...

131
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,760
...and then maybe we'll come back.

132
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,870
- Okay? Come on.
- Okay.

133
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,680
Can I get my face painted?

134
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,740
How about we wait until
the line is a little shorter?

135
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,920
We'll come back, okay?

136
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:08,010
- Marco.
- Polo.

137
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,980
- How old your boy?
- Six.

138
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,700
He obviously likes to hide.

139
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,380
Marco.

140
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,670
Oh, Marco.

141
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,920
Oh, no.

142
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,850
Am I lost my little Frankie forever?

143
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,800
Where could he be?

144
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,120
There you are.

145
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,520
Come on, let's go see the show.

146
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,210
Can I get my face painted now?

147
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,250
Yeah, as soon as this song is over,
okay sweetheart?

148
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,520
Frankie, I'm gonna need
my phone for one second.

149
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,190
There you go. Let's switch.

150
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,420
Hello?

151
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,150
Yeah.

152
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,050
Can you hold on just one second?

153
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,790
Okay. Frankie, listen.

154
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,530
I'm gonna have to go over there
and take this phone call, okay?

155
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,420
It's really important.
Don't move, okay?

156
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,810
- Marco.
- Polo.

157
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,270
Don't move.

158
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,400
Okay, I'm sorry. Go ahead.

159
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,040
He wants what?

160
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,030
Primary custody?

161
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,770
Well, he can't have that.
I mean, can he?

162
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,170
My batteries are gonna die, Mr. Jackson.
If it does, I'll call you back, okay?

163
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,910
- Marco.
- Polo.

164
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,510
I'm sorry. What?

165
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,040
I can't hear you. Say that again.

166
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,360
Yes, yes, I have a job.
I have a regular job. Yes.

167
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,540
Is that even gonna matter to the court?

168
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,190
Well, yeah, he's in real estate.

169
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:25,750
And his girlfriend is a pediatrician
and I'm a waitress.

170
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,010
So you do the math. Marco.

171
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,580
Polo.

172
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,850
Let me tell you something, Mr. Jackson.

173
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,810
If he thinks that he's gonna take
my son away from me just because...

174
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,500
Frankie.

175
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,050
Frankie.

176

00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,320
Excuse me, ma'am.

178
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,390
Did you see where my little boy was
that was right here?

179
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,920
No, I didn't. I'm sorry.

185
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,710

186
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,580
Are you hiding, Frankie?

187
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,050

189
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,490

- No, I can't find him.

190
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,770

194
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,240
Has anybody seen a little boy
with short curly hair?

195
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,600
What's his name, honey?
Is it Marco or Frankie?

196
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,550
Frankie!

197
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,250
- Should I call the police?
- Yes, yes, call the police.

198
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,950

Oh, God.

223
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:58,690
Where is he?

224
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,540
Don't let me lose him.

225
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:18,130
Okay, God, I know I never pray to you
unless somebody is sick.

226
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,540
Or somebody's dying or in an airplane.

227
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,100
But, God, please don't let me lose him.

228
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,210
But if you get me this one thing, God...

229
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,700
This one thing...

230
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:38,520
I will never ever ask you
for another thing as long as I live.

231
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,260
Let them be there, God.

232
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,820
Oh, thank God.
Oh, God, thank you.

233
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,550
Let him out!

234
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,590

If you let him out of that car,
I will stop chasing you.

351
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,080
I'll go away.

352
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:08,480
All I want is my son.
That's all I care about.

353
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,100
If the cops asked,
I haven't seen your face.

354
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,330
I don't know your license plate.

355
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,160
You can get away.

356
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,710
If they asked me,
I won't know anything.

357
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,290
Let me tell you something.

358
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:39,560
As long as my son is in that car...

359
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,500
...I will not stop.

360
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,820
Wherever you go...

361
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,600
...I will be right behind you.

362
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,320
No matter what.

363
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,570
- Mommy!
- Frankie.

364
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,210
Frankie.

365
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,980
Karla, unlock the door.

366
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,940
What do you want?

367
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,150
You got $10,000?

368
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,460
Yeah.

369
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,870
I'm gonna ride with you,
your son is gonna ride with him...

370
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:24,010
...and we're gonna go get that money.

371
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,570
Or you're gonna kill me.

372
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,030
That's what he wants.

373
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,360
What he wants me to do.

374
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,930
But I told him for $10,000,
we can make a new plan.

375
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,270
You want your boy and I want $10,000.

376
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:53,680
Karla, we have to get out of this field.
Unlock the door.

377
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,760
No.

378
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,580
I'm trying to save your child.

379
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:04,870
Open the door before he changes his mind.

380
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,190
Come on.
You want him to kill your son?

381
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,390
Follow him.

382
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,100
Where do I go?

383
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:52,200
Just keep going straight,
I'll tell you where to go.

384
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,820
After we get the money,
I'll give him a call...

385
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,060
...and you'll get your boy back.

386
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,730
Okay. Okay.

387
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,850
I know.

388
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,180
Go, go, go.

389
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:46,550
Okay.

390
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:49,560
So now what's the plan?

391
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:55,190
You don't really even have a plan, do you?

392
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,730
You have no idea
what to even do right now.

393
00:43:58,730 --> 00:43:59,710
You need her...

394
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:01,860
You need her to tell you
what to do, don't you?

395
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,170
Shit!

396
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,140
No!

397
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:52,260
No! Stop!

398
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,120
Frankie!

399
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,930
No!

400
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:06,840
Oh, God! I need help!

401
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:05,310
Call 911!

402
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,140
- Why?
- My son has been kidnapped!

403
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:11,750
- What?
- Repeat after me!

404
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:18,220
80's Green Mustang GT!

405
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,840
- Mustang GT.
- Call the police right now!

406
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:24,970
Call the police now!

407
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,000
Oh, no.

408
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:25,580
Please still here.

409
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:31,240
Oh my God.

410
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:38,150
Frankie!

411
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:39,990
Oh, God.

412
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,870
What happened to the people
that were in this car?

413
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:53,940
They have me right
when I pulled him down.

414
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,320
He was driving like a crazy man.

415
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,460
- Okay, did you see a little boy?
- Yeah, they went down that way.

416
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,060
Just wait, the police on their way.

417
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:03,990
That little boy is my son and
the man he was with kidnapped him.

418
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:06,260
- So tell the cops that.
- They'll be here in a minute.

419
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,810
Can't wait!

420
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:11,220
There's a police station
up the road right in town!

421
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:31,090
My son has been kidnapped.
Has anybody contacted you?

422
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:33,580
His name is Frankie,
he's six years old.

423
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:39,150
And he's wearing a blue and red shirt
and he's wearing little black glasses.

424
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:40,670
And this right here is something I have...

425
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:43,070
...a woman's voice on the exact moment
that she was taking him.

426
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,920
She's talking on here.
She's a big huge lady.

427
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,620
And right now he is with a man...

428
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,990
Okay, calm down.
We're gonna call it in immediately.

429
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:53,400
- What's your name, ma'am.
- My name is Karla Dyson.

430
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,510
- Describe the suspect for me.
- He's tall, skinny, white.

431
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:59,690
He has a red baseball cap
with blonde hair sticking out of it.

432
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:06,460
And he has on like a gray or blue,
some kind of work uniform, I don't know.

433
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:07,520
Wait a minute.

434
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,260
- Is nobody here with you?
- No, ma'am.

435
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:13,230
But we can have a hundred cars
looking for them in an hour, okay?

436
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:14,890
- An hour? Oh my God, in an hour?
- I just need you to be patient.

437
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:16,980
My son is gonna be dead in an hour!

438
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,870
No, no, it's going online.

439
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:21,860
Every cop in the Parish
is gonna be looking for him, Karla.

440
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:23,100
Oh, God.

441
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,140
Issuing amber alert
for a potential kidnapping.

442
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:33,710
A six years old African-American boy.
Last seen wearing a blue and red shirt.

443
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:37,040
Responds to Frankie Dyson.
The mother is here with me at the station.

444
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,480
Do you have a cellphone that I can use...

445
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,640
...so if I go out there I can call and
stay in touch with you?

446
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:43,390
No, ma'am. But you can use that phone
right over on that wall.

447
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:44,910
I cannot use that phone?
It's right there.

448
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:46,400
Anyone you need to call?

449
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:48,800
Your husband?

450
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,760
Okay, my husband, yes.

451
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:55,370
- I need to call my husband.
- 9 in the area code.

452
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:58,630
I've put out an APP for Jefferson Parish.

453
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:00,560
You just need to wait, Karla.

454
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:03,660
<i>You've reach David Dyson.
I'm away from my desk right now.</i>

455
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:06,330
<i>I'll get back to you
as soon as possible. Thank you.</i>

456
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,060
Hi, David.

457
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:10,130
It's me.

458
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,110
I am in a police station in Chester.

459
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:17,230
Frankie's been kidnapped.

460
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:19,310
Happened at the park.

461
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,620
The police are out doing everything
they can looking for him.

462
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:28,250
And they said that all we have to do now
is just sit right and wait.

463
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:02,620
That's what all these people did.

464
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,540
They waited.

465
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,740
Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.
Ma'am? Ma'am?

466
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:41,570
Excuse me, did you see a man
with a little boy?

467
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:57,740
Is that your jacket?

468
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:02,640
That's your jacket.

469
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:42,060
Frankie?

470
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:16,770
I found you, you son of a bitch!

471
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:06,870
No! No, that's not it!
It's a black Volvo!

472
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,000
Goddamnit!

473
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,870
Goddamnit.

474
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:19,510
No! You are not opening that door!

475
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:24,190
I said no!

476
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:32,680
Fuck you!

477
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:36,750
No!

478
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:46,770
Oh, God. No!

479
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:48,010
No!

480
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:52,060
No, no, no...

481
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,640
Don't stop, don't stop.

482
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:33,740
- I need help!
- Are you alright?

483
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:35,860
- Do you have a phone?
- I got a radio.

484
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:38,310
Call 911.
My son has been kidnapped!

485
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:42,080
- Call 911.
- Okay, but I got to go this way.

486
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,480
- I don't get a reception over here.
- But they went that way!

487
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,240
That way is a dead end.

488
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,720
Dead end? What do you mean?

489
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:50,850
Look out!

490
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:49,220
Damnit! Where's my shells?

491
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:33,960
You had to keep coming, didn't you?

492
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:47,630
Where's my son?

493
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:51,380
Where's my son!

494
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,560
Terrence Vicky? Is that who you are?

495
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:29,670
Were.

496
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:34,820
125, Route 77.

497
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:36,600
Okay.

498
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:38,860
Let's see.

499
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,770
<i>Continue on route 77 for 2 miles.</i>

500
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:51,530
<i>Your destination will be on the left.</i>

501
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,220
Hello?

502
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,760
He ain't here.

503
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:29,610
Yes, we got another one
and now everything is gone to shit!

504
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:37,910
Okay, then the price just doubled
because this mother has become a problem.

505
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:45,010
I told you Terry ain't here.
I had to hitch a ride back.

506
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:49,660
He's out taking care of the problem.

507
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:54,920
Just remember,
you are just the middleman.

508
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:58,080
It'll be a $100,000 or you get nothing.

509
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:55,870
<i>911 operator, what's your emergency?</i>

510
01:12:55,870 --> 01:12:57,130
I need help.

511
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:01,740
<i>Ma'am?</i>

512
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:04,610
<i>Ma'am, are you there? Ma'am?</i>

513
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,190
<i>Ma'am, we're here with you.</i>

514
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:09,340
<i>We're keeping the line open,
we're gonna get you some help.</i>

515
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:10,510
<i>Do not hang up.</i>

516
01:13:10,510 --> 01:13:13,110
<i>I'm gonna place you on hold
while we triangulate your location.</i>

517
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,970
<i>I'll be right back with you.</i>

518
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:42,200
<i>Ma'am, I'm back. Is it safe to talk?</i>

519
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:45,140
- What is your emergency?
- My son has been kidnapped.

520
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:47,680
And I'm in the house where I think
they're keeping him.

521
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:50,290
<i>We think we found you.
Can you verified your address?</i>

522
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:52,570
Yes. 125, route 77.

523
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:55,740
<i>And do you know if there's anyone else
in the house with you, ma'am?</i>

524
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:58,340
I don't know, I'm not sure, but...

525
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:02,600
But the woman that took him is out
in a barn or some house.

526
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:03,670
It's near where I am.

527
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:05,450
<i>I've already contacted
the dispatch officers.</i>

528
01:14:05,450 --> 01:14:06,430
<i>They're on the way.</i>

529
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:08,460
<i>You need to find a safe place
to wait until they're arrive.</i>

530
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:10,480
Okay. How long is that gonna take?

531
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,430
<i>They'll be there very soon.</i>

532
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:13,430
<i>I just need you to stay
on the line with me, okay?</i>

533
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:14,150
Okay.

534
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:17,590
- Is that gonna be like 5 minutes?
- Between 7-15 minutes, ma'am.

535
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:20,040
Oh, God, 15 minutes...
That's a long time.

536
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,870
<i>It's alright, ma'am.
The police are on their way.</i>

537
01:14:21,870 --> 01:14:25,590
<i>I need you to get to a safe place,
stay here on the line with me now, okay?</i>

538
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:30,490
<i>Would you let me know when
you find a safe place to hide?</i>

539
01:14:31,470 --> 01:14:32,950
<i>Ma'am, are you there?</i>

540
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:36,500
- Ma'am? Ma'am?
- Hang up, hang up.

541
01:14:38,130 --> 01:14:39,180
Oh, God.

542
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:47,130
Terry!

543
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,820
Terry, are you back?

544
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:56,300
Terry, was that you on the phone?

545
01:14:58,640 --> 01:14:59,580
Terry!

546
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:20,050
Terry!

547
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:15,370
Frankie.

548
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:44,750
Frankie?

549
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:51,570
<i>Mommy?</i>

550
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:53,470
Frankie?

551
01:17:54,590 --> 01:17:55,980
<i>Mommy?</i>

552
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:58,200
Where are you, sweetheart?

553
01:17:58,420 --> 01:17:59,750
Frankie.

554
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:03,220
- Where are you, honey?
- Up here.

555
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:07,030
Mommy, mommy.

556
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:08,980
- Hi, sweetheart.
- I'm scared.

557
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:11,120
- Where have you been?
- Yes, I'm gonna get you down.

558
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,690
I'm gonna get you down, honey.

559
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:14,890
<i>Are you the police?</i>

560
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:18,070
What is that, Frankie?

561
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:21,420
- I'm Lucy.
- I'm Libby.

562
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:23,390
Oh my God, there's...

563
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:25,190
There's three of you up there.

564
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:28,150
- Mommy, give me a help.
- Okay, honey, look...

565
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:30,420
I'm gonna get you down, okay?

566
01:18:30,930 --> 01:18:33,160
- Come up the ladder.
- I can't.

567
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:36,130
I can't, honey,
because the ladder is locked.

568
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:40,370
So you're gonna have to come down
through this hole.

569
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,640
But first I'm gonna have to get...
No, no, Frankie, don't.

570
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:45,930
No, don't put your legs down, honey.
You can't fit through there.

571
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:49,210
- No, just wait a second.
- Grab me.

572
01:18:49,210 --> 01:18:52,600
Put your legs up, Frankie,
so mommy can hit with the shovel.

573
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,990
- Put your legs...
- Grab me.

574
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:02,160
Okay, Frankie, listen.
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

575
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,970
- No, mommy, wait!
- You wait right there.

576
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:22,140
Frankie, Frankie, put your legs
back up in that hole, okay?

577
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:23,140
We're gonna have to go fast.

578
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:25,650
Get your legs back up in that hole,
Frankie, right now!

579
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:27,690
- Mommy, mommy...
- Frankie!

580
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:51,820
Okay. Okay, come on, Frankie.
Come on.

581
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:07,250
- Come on, girls. Come on.
- No, I'm scared.

582
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:10,180
- Come on, you have to come down.
- I want my mommy.

583
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:13,720
Okay, okay, okay.

584
01:20:13,770 --> 01:20:16,380
We're gonna play the quiet game, okay?

585
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:19,450
I need both of you to be very quiet,
don't make a sound, okay?

586
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:22,560
I'm gonna come back.
I'm gonna come back for you, okay?

587
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,950
Go get her! Get her!

588
01:20:28,410 --> 01:20:29,200
Come on.

589
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:31,470
Come on.

590
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:39,820
Okay, Frankie, we're gonna have to hide.

591
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:32,320
You sit right here, okay?

592
01:24:33,450 --> 01:24:35,440
I'm gonna go get the girls, okay?

593
01:24:35,810 --> 01:24:37,330
We'll get them out of here.

594
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:43,000
Hi, you guys, I'm back.

595
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:46,510
- Come on, it's time to come down now.
- I want my mommy.

596
01:24:46,510 --> 01:24:48,200
It's okay, sweetheart.
Come on down.

597
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:51,010
Come on, honey. I'm here to help you.
It's okay.

598
01:24:54,190 --> 01:24:55,950
What the hell is going on here?

599
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:57,870
Who the hell are you?

600
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:02,360
- Who are you?
- I live next door.

601
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:03,900
I heard gunshots.

602
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:06,210
Where's Margo?

603
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:10,480
- In the water.
- What?

604
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:11,720
Yeah.

605
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:14,600
She and her husband kidnapped my son.

606
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:18,250
I've lived next to the Vicky's
for 14 years.

607
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:21,510
They ain't kidnappers.
You turn around.

608
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:27,920
I called the police, you know.

609
01:25:29,850 --> 01:25:34,200
- Who's up there?
- Those are kids. More abducted kids.

610
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:37,760
Yeah, they're up there in that hole.

611
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:43,370
Dear Lord.

612
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:46,210
We have to get them down.

613
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:48,310
Hey, you two.

614
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:51,250
We're gonna get you down
from there right now.

615
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:55,410
- I wanna go home!
- We are gonna go home right now.

616
01:25:55,410 --> 01:25:56,810
Both of you.

617
01:25:58,100 --> 01:26:00,090
Just come to the opening.

618
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:02,130
Come on, girls.

619
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:03,770
Come on.

620
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,770
Wait a minute.
I never told you how many.

621
01:26:09,150 --> 01:26:11,730
And I never told you they were girls.

622
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,770
You took the wrong kid.

623
01:26:50,650 --> 01:26:52,400
Oh, sweetheart...

624
01:27:46,370 --> 01:27:48,860
<i>This is Julian Buescher with
an unbelievable story...</i>

625
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:50,990
<i>...breaking out of
Jefferson Parish right now.</i>

626
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,540
<i>Three suspected
child abductor are dead...</i>

627
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:55,850
<i>...and a woman is reunited
with her son tonight.</i>

628
01:27:55,850 --> 01:27:59,290
<i>After what police called it
an unprecedented civilian pursuit.</i>

629
01:27:59,290 --> 01:28:03,310
<i>Amazingly, the mother got into her
own vehicle and chase the suspects.</i>

630
01:28:03,310 --> 01:28:05,020
<i>A police spokesman has confirmed...</i>

631
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:07,970
<i>...the break of an overseas
child abduction ring.</i>

632
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:12,840
<i>Arrests has been made in Paris,
New York, London and Dubai.</i>

633
01:28:13,090 --> 01:28:16,260
<i>This mother is one incredible hero.</i>
